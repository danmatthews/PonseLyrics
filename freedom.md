# FREEDOM

Take a number and get back on track,
say your prayers cos you're never coming back,
cos you're suffocating, you're stuck within these walls,
cut the ties with ignorance, now you know it all.

You're educated, and you know that something's wrong,
but your patience, can only last so long.
You're wound so tight, that your screws are coming loose,
these walls are closing in and your throbbing heads your proof.

We don't need your rules,
We don't need your opinions,
We don't need your arguments, yeah,
Cos we'll do what we want.
