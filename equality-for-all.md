# EQUALITY FOR ALL.

What's it all about, what does freedom mean to me? EVERYTHING, and that's the way it's meant to be.
People think they can change the way we act, reduce our world to ashes and then never look back,
Well it's time to save ourselves (From this so called democracy),
It's time to save ourselves (And that's the way it's got to be).

The politicians, are all just filled with shit and lies,
They want equality but never find a reason why,
They all just think that the problems will just go away,
and never care what the people have to say.

Tonight we'll make a stand (put our differences aside for now),
Tonight we'll make a stand (forget the who, the why or the how).
