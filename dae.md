# DAE (Dating Agency Elf)

Give it a tug, blocking out your ugly mug,
Blowing my load, was always easier on my own.
A box of tissues, is now my one and only friend.
All this hard work, but it'll pay off in the end.

## PRECHORUS

And all this hard work, but it'll pay off in the end. (x2)

## CHORUS
Never had the time, to sit around and whine.
It's never helped me in the past.
But now i'm trying, to medicate my mind,
And get a grip on life at last.

I needed a hug, could only get one from myself.
I went to a dating service, they set me up with a fucking elf,
And i wanted, was someone to save me all the work.
But now i've found someone, i no longer need to jerk.

## PRECHORUS
Now i've found someone, i no longer need to jerk (x2)

## CHORUS
Never had the time, to sit around and whine.
It's never helped me in the past.
But now i'm trying, to medicate my mind,
And get a grip on life at last.
