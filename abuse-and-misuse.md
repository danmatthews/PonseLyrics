# ABUSE AND MISUSE

## (VERSE 1)
All these problems, keep on adding up inside my head.
Liquid anesthesia, is what i need instead.
The bottom of a glass, it's never looked so good before,
Drink 'til my head is heavy, and my body, hits the floor.

## (CHORUS)
And if i drink, just a little more.
Then i'll be drunk enough, not to care any more.
And if i drink, just a little more.
Then i think i'll drown, in every little thought.

## (VERSE 2)
In the morning, my head is heavy, throat is sore.
And i'm bouncing off the walls again.
And i try to think, back to the night before,
but nothing seems to spring to mind.
